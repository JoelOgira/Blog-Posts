      "body": "The design choices react team have made in useEffect hook are still a heated debate. Some people like it and some don’t.\n\nIf you don't come from the React world it’ll definitely sound strange because its default behaviour is the dreaded “Infinite Render Loop” which is pretty easy to run into. For example\n\nuseEffect(()=>{console.log(\"Hello World\")})\nLooks fine right?\nNope, this will print “Hello World” in every render and the React dev OCD in me can't wait to put a second dependency array like this"

This will help put out the word outside there and you will always be given priority whenever such need arises. Extensive marketing will ensure the farmer will always have the necessary market, thus they will be able to make profits from this venture. All in all, goat farming is a profitable venture that if undertaken properly will bring the farmer immense profits."

Remember all we used to do in the starlight of the night. \nYou're just another scar left on my heart, a sign we are meant to be apart. \nAnd even though I know you're not the one I'm gonna miss you daily.\n\nFloating but I think I'll get over you, I'll try to focus on what's infront of me but not behind.\nWhat is love without the one you love the most. \nWho I am without you."
